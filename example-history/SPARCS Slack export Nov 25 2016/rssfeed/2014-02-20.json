I&amp;#39;ve got a method that estimates these already, I&amp;#39;d just like to throw them into an HMM library without having to take the time to code my own. However, the Matlab and SciKitLearn HMM tools both seem to assume static probs. Does anyone have a suggestion for one that allows changing probs?

Essentially level data would be stored in an encrypted format, and the correct answer to a puzzle would be used to derive an encryption key that will decrypt the level so it can be played. That would mean that at least one person would have to solve the puzzle and disclose the answer before the next part of the story would be revealed, which might be useful for building a community around story-based games.  su...",
