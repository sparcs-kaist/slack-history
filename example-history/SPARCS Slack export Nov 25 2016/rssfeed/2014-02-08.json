It looks like this: $charHash{$alignI}{$key} So far I can print it out so that for each $alignI, each $key is printed. Now I kind of want to print out each $key first. For example, if I have five values for $alignI (0,1,2,3,4) and five values for $key (A,B,C,D,E) I want to print it so that the first line reads $align = 0, $key = A, $align = 0, $key = B, etc.  Any help would be nice! Thank you!  submitted by  shamWOW15  to  perl  [link] [\ub313\uae00 \ub2ec\uae30...",
