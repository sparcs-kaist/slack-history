Currently I&amp;#39;m doing college programming exercise for a class regarding a name generator using social security data for the last 100 years or so. It then outputs different fields of information. I thought its sort of interesting and wanted to see what everyone else is working on.  submitted by  NewFrontGamer  to  java  [link] [\ub313\uae00 \ub2ec\uae30]",
